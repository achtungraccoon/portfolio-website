                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who</strong> This tool is for people who want to save money, quickly, for a particular
                        reason. For example, a wedding, big trip, or new car. The users are not new to technology but do
                        not
                        like working with their finances. So, they require that the information they receive via the
                        tool is
                        accessible, and clearly tells them what they can do to better save and meet goals.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>What</strong> A responsive website, web app, and/or mobile app allowing all data on
                        income
                        and expenses to be recorded easily, on the go, and from a variety of devices. The tool displays
                        data
                        on the user’s finances (how much money they spend and on what), and tells them what they can do
                        to
                        cut costs and save money in a certain amount of time. The app also showcases the progress of a
                        user’s savings goal.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>When</strong> Users will utilize the tool in the period before a planned expense. During
                        this period, they will input data when spending and receiving money so they can view accurate
                        information on their finances and dynamic information on what they can do to save more money.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Where</strong> From anywhere and using any device to ensure income and outgoings are
                        easily
                        recorded.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Why</strong> Saving money can be really hard, especially when you don’t have a long time
                        to
                        do so. By providing personalized information on how a user can save based on their actual
                        finances,
                        the tool itself can provide financial advice during these finite periods of saving.</li>
